I graduated from Boston College with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science, and a minor in Philosophy. I am passionate about researching deep neural network interpretability and developing interpretable and modular AI systems. 

Currently, while continuing my research at Boston College as a research assistant(working with Professor Yuan Yuan), focusing on fields like Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and vision-language models to broaden my understanding of AI, I also serve as the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) at Blossoms AI. Blossoms AI is an educational technology startup I co-founded to create new norms in education through AI.

I am pursuing a PhD in the AI/ML field during the 2024/2025 application term to further my research and academic pursuits. Please feel free to reach out to discuss potential opportunities.

## Branch Specialization Analysis Project 🌳

<img src="https://github.com/ritengzhang/ritengzhang.github.io/blob/e4a2a3af80d99f621597987b2ea102a648469d71/branch.png?raw=true" align="left" width="300" height="300" alt="Branch Specialization Analysis">

The Branch Specialization[3] Analysis Project is a project of my own that will have several stages. Currently, it's in the very early stages with a focus on providing baseline and evaluation metrics for branch specialization consistency and exploring the potential of branch specialization in combining the functional and architectural modularity of deep learning models. Understanding and analyzing branch specialization is crucial for several reasons:

&nbsp; - It aids in creating more interpretable models, as it becomes clearer what roles different parts of the network are playing.

&nbsp; -  It can lead to more efficient network designs, where unnecessary or redundant branches can be identified and pruned without loss of overall functionality.

&nbsp; - It provides insights that can be utilized in neural architecture search (NAS) to design optimized and task-specific models.

[**Analyzing Variations in Branch Attribution in Non-monolithic Models**](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Interpretability-of-Inception-and-its-variants) (advised by [Professor Sergio Alvarez](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/computer-science/people/faculty-directory/sergio-alvarez.html))

This paper investigates the variability in layer feature attribution across different branches in various branched neural networks (monolithic design vs. inception-like). Despite using consistent datasets, model architectures, and hyperparameters, training with different initial parameters leads to differences in neuron roles and contributions. Our focus is on determining whether the monolithic design of branched models will have higher variation in its branch attribution than that of inception-like models or non-monolithic branched neural networks.

[**Interpretability Formalizing and Automating Framework**](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Interpretability-of-neural-language-model-A-survey) 

Inspired by "Post-hoc Interpretability for Neural NLP: A Survey," I aimed to encode interpretability methods into a structured, formal framework using Python classes, this new project seeks to establish a unified representation that automatically captures the essence (functionality and application) of deep learning interpretability methods across various dimensions. It categorizes interpretability methods based on characteristics such as global vs. local, similar to what previous surveys have done, and evaluates their complexity, fidelity, etc. The project also hopes to generate new methods through innovative approaches, such as generative sequence models (like tree RNNs).

[**Evaluation of LLM Zero to Few-Shot Ability when Expecting Formatted Output**](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Evaluation-of-LLM-Zero-to-Few-Shot-Ability-when-Expecting-Formatted-Output) 

These experiments are designed to systematically evaluate the performance of GPT models under various conditions, focusing on their ability to generate formatted output and provide accurate answers. The collected metrics aid in assessing the models' capabilities and limitations in handling diverse scenarios and formatting requirements.

As CAIO and co-founder of Blossoms AI, I am deeply committed to transforming education through the power of artificial intelligence. At Blossoms AI, we believe that a personalized, individualized, and customized approach is key to unlocking every student's full potential. Our goal is to provide teachers with the tools and resources they need to save time, increase efficiency, and focus on nurturing the unique abilities and interests of each student.

My roles at Blossoms AI include:
- Managing an AI engineering team of 6-7 people responsible for designing, developing, testing, and monitoring AI products in education technology.
- Designing and implementing AI workflows and ensuring AI-related backend workflows are efficient and secure.
- Co-founding and making strategic decisions related to artificial intelligence.
- Developing tools aimed at reshaping higher education norms, such as Auto-Oral Defense, Mastery Level System, ThinkAid, and Adaptive Extra-Credit Assignment System.
- Creating a tool that automatically performs data analysis and generates insightful reports or engages in user chats. This tool can be utilized by students, teachers, and school districts with different levels of authorization and is applicable to databases in any field.

Note: Blossoms AI, an educational technology startup I co-founded, aims to create new norms in education in the age of AI. Our mission is to address the damage AI has caused to the current education system and to build a new system using AI and other tools. Our application is set to be implemented in several high schools and potentially colleges next semester.
