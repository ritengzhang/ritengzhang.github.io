# Hi, I'm Riteng (Gavin) Zhang! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
An undergraduate Boston College student who loves to study the interpretability of neural networks and reasoning in nlp. I am majoring in Math and CS, with a philosophy minor.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Interpretability of Inception and its Variants](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Interpretability-of-Inception-and-its-variants), [Interpretability of LLM and an Automated Finetuning Model](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Interpretability-of-llm-and-an-automated-finetuning-framework).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also working under [Professor Emily Prud'hommeaux](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/computer-science/people/faculty-directory/emily-prudhommeaux.html) on topics including ASR for under-resourced language, Language Models Evaluation for Neuroatypical Language, etc.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve previously worked on [Evaluation of GPT-3.5 Chat Creation Few-Shot Ability with Formatted Output](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Evaluation-on-Few-Shot-formattingability-of-GPT-chat-creation)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **GANs, ML Engineering for Production...**

-[Evaluation of LLM Zero to Few-Shot Ability when Expecting Formatted Output](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Evaluation-on-Few-Shot-formattingability-of-GPT-chat-creation)

It's simple to use LLM like GPT chat creation as a chatbot, but what if we want LLMs with chat creation functions to do a traditional task on a huge dataset? The high-quality content in LLMs' output is assured for such traditional tasks even when using zero-shot, but without using fine-tuning or few-shot, the output is not formatted in any expected way. How to make LLMs output in an expected way? Do we give instructions? How many examples for Few-Shot? Is fine-tuning still necessary even when the format is complicated?

## Startup-[Blossoms ai](Blossoms.ai)
At BlossomsAI, we are on a mission to transform education by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence. We firmly believe that a personalized, individualized, and customized approach to education can unlock the full potential of every child. Our goal is to equip teachers with the tools and resources necessary to save time, increase efficiency, and focus on nurturing each student's unique abilities and interests. 

I am responsible for everything related to AI or ML in BlossomsAI.

## Other Interesting Projects
-[MBTI classification using social media posts](https://github.com/YifanZhou1999/NLP_project_Fall_22)

In this project, we use around 50 Twitter posts from the same person to predict the corresponding MBTI using various models, from simple models such as KNN and SVM (feature or encoding retrieved by transformers) to transformers including Bert and DistilBert setting different layers opened for training. The result is not satisfying though.

-[Classification of MRI on Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
](https://github.com/zhangcoj/ML_Project)

Using customized simple cv models and famous models such as inception to predict the level of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease using the MRI image of the brain.
