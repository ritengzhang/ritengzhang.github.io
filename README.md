I graduated from Boston College with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science, and a minor in Philosophy. I am passionate about researching deep neural network interpretability and developing interpretable and modular AI systems. 

Currently, while continuing my research at Boston College as a research assistant(working with Professor Yuan Yuan), focusing on fields like Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and vision-language models to broaden my understanding of AI, I also serve as the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) at Blossoms AI. Blossoms AI is an educational technology startup I co-founded to create new norms in education through AI.

I am pursuing a PhD in the AI/ML field during the 2024/2025 application term to further my research and academic pursuits. Please feel free to reach out.

## üë®‚Äçüéì About Me

I have strong interests in various academic fields, including history, epistemology, philosophy, theology, cosmology, and neuroscience. The dynamic interplay of these diverse areas of knowledge sparks numerous insights, enriching my life and fueling creativity in my research and industrial work.

This spirit of broad learning before specialization led me, after some exploration in interpretability, to decide to shift my focus for a year to researching the hottest fields like vision and language to expand my understanding of AI from different perspectives, preparing for better ways of building interpretable and modular AI systems. Since interpretability and AI itself should not be treated merely as fundamental science but as something meant to be applied, I avoid concentrating on a narrow set of tools for too long, as it can lead us astray from the ultimate goal.

## üîç Research Interests

- Mechanistic Interpretability
- Deep Learning Model Modularity
- Interpretability in LLM or advanced Models (Emergent Ability/Behavior)
- Formalization and Automation of Interpretable ML Systems
- Neural Architecture Search
- Transparent, Trustworthy, Robust AI; ML Safety

As CAIO and co-founder of Blossoms AI, I am dedicated to transforming education through artificial intelligence. Our mission is to address the shortcomings of the current education system, especially in the age of AI, and to build a new one using AI and other innovative tools. Our application is set to be implemented in several high schools and potentially colleges next semester, helping teachers save time, increase efficiency, and focus on nurturing each student's unique abilities and interests.

My roles at Blossoms AI include:
- Managing an AI engineering team of 6-7 people responsible for designing, developing, testing, and monitoring AI products in education technology.
- Developing tools aimed at reshaping higher education norms, such as Auto-Oral Defense, Mastery Level System, ThinkAid, and Adaptive Extra-Credit Assignment System.
- Creating a tool that automatically performs data analysis and generates insightful reports or engages in user chats. This tool can be utilized by students, teachers, and school districts with different levels of authorization and is applicable to databases in any field.

## üå≥ Branch Specialization Analysis Project

<img src="https://github.com/ritengzhang/ritengzhang.github.io/blob/e4a2a3af80d99f621597987b2ea102a648469d71/branch.png?raw=true" align="left" width="300" height="300" alt="Branch Specialization Analysis">

The Branch Specialization[3] Analysis Project is a project of my own that will have several stages. Currently, it's in the very early stages with a focus on providing baseline and evaluation metrics for branch specialization consistency and exploring the potential of branch specialization in combining the functional and architectural modularity of deep learning models. Understanding and analyzing branch specialization is crucial for several reasons:

&nbsp; - It aids in creating more interpretable models, as it becomes clearer what roles different parts of the network are playing.

&nbsp; -  It can lead to more efficient network designs, where unnecessary or redundant branches can be identified and pruned without loss of overall functionality.

&nbsp; - It provides insights that can be utilized in neural architecture search (NAS) to design optimized and task-specific models.

[**Analyzing Variations in Branch Attribution in Non-monolithic Models**](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Interpretability-of-Inception-and-its-variants) (advised by [Professor Sergio Alvarez](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/computer-science/people/faculty-directory/sergio-alvarez.html))

This paper investigates the variability in layer feature attribution across different branches in various branched neural networks (monolithic design vs. inception-like). Despite using consistent datasets, model architectures, and hyperparameters, training with different initial parameters leads to differences in neuron roles and contributions. Our focus is on determining whether the monolithic design of branched models will have higher variation in its branch attribution than that of inception-like models or non-monolithic branched neural networks.

[**Interpretability Formalizing and Automating Framework**](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Interpretability-of-neural-language-model-A-survey) 

Inspired by "Post-hoc Interpretability for Neural NLP: A Survey," I aimed to encode interpretability methods into a structured, formal framework using Python classes, this new project seeks to establish a unified representation that automatically captures the essence (functionality and application) of deep learning interpretability methods across various dimensions. It categorizes interpretability methods based on characteristics such as global vs. local, similar to what previous surveys have done, and evaluates their complexity, fidelity, etc. The project also hopes to generate new methods through innovative approaches, such as generative sequence models (like tree RNNs).
