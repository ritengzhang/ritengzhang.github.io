# Hi, I'm Riteng (Gavin) Zhang! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
An undergraduate Boston College student who loves to study the interpretability of neural networks. I am majoring in Math and CS, with a philosophy minor.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Interpretability of Inception and its Variants](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Interpretability-of-Inception-and-its-variants), [Interpretability of LLM and an Automated Finetuning Model](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Interpretability-of-llm-and-an-automated-finetuning-framework).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also working under [Professor Emily Prud'hommeaux](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/computer-science/people/faculty-directory/emily-prudhommeaux.html) on topics including ASR for under-resourced language, Language Models Evaluation for Neuroatypical Language, etc.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve previously worked on [Evaluation of GPT-3.5 Chat Creation Few-Shot Ability with Formatted Output](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Evaluation-on-Few-Shot-formattingability-of-GPT-chat-creation)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **GANs, ML Engineering for Production...**

-[Evaluation of GPT-3.5 Chat Creation Few-Shot Ability with Formatted Output](https://github.com/ritengzhang/Evaluation-on-Few-Shot-formattingability-of-GPT-chat-creation)

It's simple to use GPT chat creation as a chatbot, but what if we want GPT models with chat creation functions to do a traditional task on a huge dataset? The high-quality content of GPT output is assured for such traditional tasks even using zero-shot, but without using finetuning or few-shot, the output is not formatted in any expected way. How to make GPT 3.5 and 4 output in an expected way? Do we give instructions? How many examples for Few-Shot? Is fine-tuning still necessary even when the format is complicated?

## Other Interesting Projects
-[MBTI classification using social media posts](https://github.com/YifanZhou1999/NLP_project_Fall_22)

In this project, we use around 50 Twitter posts from the same person to predict the corresponding MBTI using various models, from simple models such as KNN and SVM (feature or encoding retrieved by transformers) to transformers including Bert and DistilBert setting different layers opened for training. The result is not satisfying though.

-[Classification of MRI on Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
](https://github.com/zhangcoj/ML_Project)

Using customized simple cv models and famous models such as inception to predict the level of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease using the MRI image of the brain.
